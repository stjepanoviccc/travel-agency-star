In /templates i have several different folder to maintain this project easier.

/fragments -> are used for reusable components
/editPages -> i stored all edit pages here to be more precize because they aren't main pages like cart,dashboard etc.

IMPORTANT:
dont mix /dashboard and dashboard.html -> in /dashboard folder i store every subroute like /destinations etc... but in pure dashboard.html i store user maintenance.
