In this folder "/fragments" i stored reusable things like form, modals etc..
I could take this all as 'components' but i wanted to separate concerns.

/cards, /forms, /modals as name says.

/tableItems -> used for reusable components in table for cleaner code
/ui -> just random ui things for separated pages.
